![license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/adelezaini/MachineLearning)

🚧 *This repository is WIP*

This repository aims to explore different tecniques of Machine Learning and Data Analysis, such as Linear and Logistic Regression, Neural Networks and Deep Learning methods, Decision Trees...

It is created for the course [*FYS-STK4155 - Applied Data Analysis and Machine Learning*](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/fys/FYS-STK4155/index-eng.html) held by professor [Morten Hjorth-Jensen](https://github.com/mhjensen) (University of Oslo, AY2021-2022).

## Description
Different techniques of Applied Data Analysis and Machine Learning are here explored. The work is divided into three projects:

### Project1
- *Topics:* Regression and resampling techniques (OLS, Ridge, Lasso Regression - Bootstrap and cross validation). Bias-variance analysis.
- *Main contributors:* [Fridtjof Gjengset](https://github.com/fridtjrg), [Adele Zaini](https://github.com/adelezaini) and [Gaute Holen](https://github.com/GauteHolen) (have a look also at the [original repository](https://github.com/fridtjrg/FYS-STK4155)).
- *Deadline:* 11 Oct 2021 (POSTPONED: 13 Oct 2021)
### Project2
- *Topics:* Stochastic Gradient Descent, Neural Network, Logistic Regression
- *Contributor:* [Adele Zaini](https://github.com/adelezaini)
- *Deadline:* 20 Nov 2021

### Project3
- *Topics:* 
- *Deadline:* 17 Dic 2021

📂 All the material is located on the ```Projects``` directory, including the source codes and delivery reports (quick link here for the [```reports``` directory](https://github.com/fridtjrg/FYS-STK4155/tree/main/projects/reports)). In the ```projects``` directory, you can find a `README.md` file explaining the folder structure.

*Advise*: the Jupyter Notebooks may not display properly when opened directly from Github , we suggest to download the file and open them locally.
